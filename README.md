### Approach
Using a React app build and React-Leaflet to display in 2d of nyc sidewalks and the . 


### Challenges
I found that the vector data of the sidewalls was quite heavy when displayed and used topoJSON to filter that data. The next approach in regards to that I would need to filter the data.

### Next steps for a full product 
I would like to have the legend and street data to be user interactive with the times of the day. In addition an input street name data that correlates with the coordinates of the current data. This would allow users to give input based on there location. Another step to take would be to build a backend that can store live user input or live data of the amount of people present at a specific street.
